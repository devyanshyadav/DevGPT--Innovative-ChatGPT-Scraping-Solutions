![DevGPT](public/banner.png)


## üöÄ Project Overview

DevGPT is a unique project that provides an alternative method to interact with ChatGPT by bypassing traditional API limitations. Instead of using official LLM APIs, this project employs web scraping techniques with Puppeteer to fetch responses directly from the ChatGPT web interface.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimer

**PRACTICE PROJECT NOTICE**
- This is a **experimental/practice project**
- Not intended for production use
- May have significant limitations and potential issues
- Use at your own risk
- Potential instability due to web scraping techniques
- Subject to breaking changes in ChatGPT's website structure

## üåü Key Features

- **Direct Web Scraping**: Extracts ChatGPT responses without using official APIs
- **Automated Login**: Seamless Gmail authentication
- **Bypass Scraping Detection**: Advanced techniques to circumvent anti-scraping mechanisms
- **RESTful API Endpoint**: `/api/generate` for easy integration
- **Dynamic Browser Interaction**: Puppeteer-powered response generation

## üîß Project Constants

The project uses the following key constants (from `src/utils/constants.ts`):

| Constant | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `COOKIES_PATH` | `"cookies.json"` | Path for storing authentication cookies |
| `LOGIN_DELAY` | `5000` | Delay (in ms) during login process |
| `GPT_URL` | `"https://chatgpt.com/"` | Target ChatGPT website URL |
| `BROWSER_OPEN` | `true` | Flag to control browser visibility |
| `BROWSER_WITHOUT_RESOURCES` | `false` | Flag to control resource loading |
| `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS` | `5 * 60 * 1000` | Rate limit window (in ms) |
| `RATE_LIMIT_MAX` | `100` | Maximum requests per window |

## üõ† Technology Stack

- TypeScript
- Puppeteer
- Express.js
- Gmail Authentication

## üì¶ Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+ recommended)
- npm or yarn
- Gmail account for authentication

## ÔøΩ Authentication and Privacy

### Gmail Login Requirement

- **Why Gmail?** ChatGPT requires authentication before accessing its services
- A Gmail account is necessary to log in and interact with the ChatGPT interface
- **Privacy Assurance**: 
  - Credentials are **ONLY** used locally for authentication
  - No credentials are transmitted, stored, or shared externally
  - Credentials are used solely to establish a browser session

### Credential Handling

1. Store credentials securely in `.env` or `.env.local`
2. Never commit credentials to version control
3. Use environment variables for sensitive information

```bash
# Example .env file
GMAIL_EMAIL=your_email@gmail.com
GMAIL_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
```

**Important**: 
- Recommend using an app-specific password
- Consider two-factor authentication for added security
- Credentials are processed entirely within your local environment
